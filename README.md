# Christoferson Chua  
Cloud Architect | Generative AI Engineer | AI Agents & LLM Applications

I design and build scalable, secure, and well-architected cloud-native systems on AWS, with a strong specialization in Generative AI, AI Agents, and LLM-powered applications.  

With more than two decades of software development experience and deep practical expertise in AWS, I focus on integrating modern AI systems with robust cloud architectures. My work covers Python-based AI development, RAG pipelines, agentic workflows, and full-stack LLM applications built for production reliability and operational excellence.

## Core Focus Areas

### Cloud Architecture (AWS)
- Serverless architectures: Lambda, API Gateway, event-driven systems  
- Containerized workloads on ECS and Fargate  
- Secure, scalable, and cost-optimized designs  
- Infrastructure as Code: CloudFormation, IaC, CI/CD pipelines  
- Identity, networking, distributed systems, and well-architected principles

### Generative AI & Agentic Systems
- AWS Bedrock (LLMs, Agents, Knowledge Bases)  
- Agentic workflows using Strands Agents and custom orchestrators  
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations and tool development  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Kendra, Knowledge Bases, LangChain  
- LLM applications using Streamlit, Chainlit, and React  
- Multi-agent orchestration, tool-use, and workflow automation

### Python Development
- End-to-end AI and ML application development  
- Streamlit applications for LLM/RAG workflows  
- FastAPI backend services  
- Bedrock SDK, LangChain, boto3  
- Data workflows, pipelines, and MLOps integrations where applicable

### Java Backend Engineering
A 13-year background in Java, including work with Spring Boot, Quarkus, and microservices, complementing my current specialization in cloud architecture and AI.
